Mann High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to reduce smoking in public places\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: In most public areas people are not penalized for smoking.  Secondhand smoke is a danger to anyone exposed, particularly children.  Our bill will penalize and restrict public smoking promoting public safety and health.  While smoking is currently restricted in government workplaces, schools, and child care facilities, smoking is not prohibited in general public areas.\n\nSection 2: No amount of secondhand smoke is safe.  Secondhand smoke has been shown in studies by the CDC to be highly detrimental to health and cause coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer.  The effect on children is even more detrimental causing asthma, respiratory infections, ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome.  A CDC study in 2012 shows that 25% of Americans were exposed to secondhand smoke.  This will most impact families below the poverty line, who are unable to afford expensive medical care for smoking related health concerns, which will then become the burden of the state.\n-Establishments would be able to apply for a license to allow patrons to smoke within their premises.  If approved, businesses must renew licenses biannually to maintain this permit, without exception.\n\nSection 3: No funding will be required for the enforcement of this bill.  It shall be enforced by Local law enforcement personnel, who already patrol public areas.  \n\nSection 4: Local law enforcement will enforce this law through the issuing of tickets, as they would with any other punishable offence.  \n\nSection 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1st, 2016.Businesses will be allowed to apply for permits one month prior to the law going into effect.\n\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015 \n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H11\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: E\nAUTHORS:  Anna Davidson and Meaghan Price\nBILL SPONSOR:\tKatherine All and Kathryn Simmons\nSCHOOL/CLUB:  J.L. Mann High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Require CPR Certification for Teachers\n \nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: CPR Certification for South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s public school teachers will make the state\xe2\x80\x99s school setting safer. This proposed law would require 75% of teachers in each public school to become CPR Certified. CPR training teaches an individual how to respond to cardiac and breathing emergencies. Teachers would be more prepared to identify health issues students could face and act quickly to resolve them. The required course would also include basic first aid training as well, teaching them how to control bleeding cuts or scrapes and how to identify heart attack or choking symptoms. \n\nSection 2: The schools will decide which teachers must become certified. The additional certified teachers will allow for a better outcome when a student faces a health emergency, and injured children will receive a faster response. Other states, like Virginia, for example, currently require all teachers to receive CPR Certification, and the list is growing. Bills have been introduced in both New York and Massachusetts. \n\nSection 3: This will be funded through an additional penny tax on cigarettes throughout South Carolina. The price of the course ranges from $40 to $60, so at most $2.7 million is needed to certify the 45,000 public school teachers. The penny tax would bring in about $3 million since about 300 million packs of cigarettes are sold a year in the state, so it would cover the expense.\n\nSection 4: It is the local school boards\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to oversee this requirement. The school must have 75% or more of the teachers certified by the end of the year the bill goes into effect.  If a school does not meet this deadline, the school board will issue a warning. If the school continues to violate the law, the school board will no longer renew the contracts of the administration at the school.\n\nSection 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016. \n\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H12\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: F\nAUTHORS:  Wyatt Meadors and George Georgopoulos\nBILL SPONSOR:\tKatherine All and Kathryn Simmons\nSCHOOL/CLUB:  J.L. Mann High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Allow the Open Carry of Handguns\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1:  The definition of a handgun is a firearm designed to be held and fired with one hand.  Currently, South Carolina has the policy that prohibits the Open Carry of Handguns.  The law that we propose will allow the Open Carry of Handguns in South Carolina.\n\nSection 2:  Our bill proposes to make South Carolina an open carry state. Residents would be required to obtain a license to carry handguns in a holster, in public, which would include a background check.  There will be areas that will not allow firearms to be openly carried such as hospitals, schools, and religious places of worship.  Since 2010, there have been 20,000 robberies, and a gun related murder occurs approximately every 14 hours in South Carolina. Currently, of the 7 states that prohibit open carry policies, 5 are in the top twenty states for gun related violence, two being in the top 5. Open Carry laws deter crime, as criminals are less likely to attack or rob an armed individual.  It has been reported that 92% of criminal attacks are deterred when a gun is merely shown.  Also, if residents are familiarized with guns, they are more likely to be used in a safe, controlled manner.\n\nSection 3:  This law will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and paid for by a 5% tax on gun sales, which would pay for the licensing and background checks for those who apply. The penalty for those openly carrying a handgun without a license, or carrying any other type of firearm with a license (hunting is not included), will be ticketed, can have the firearm confiscated, and possibly arrested, which will be determined by the circumstances.\n\nSection 4:  After being signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1, 2015\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015 \n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H13\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: A\nAUTHORS:  Madeline Huffman and Molly Grace Ashmore\nBILL SPONSOR: Katherine All and Kathryn Simmons\nSCHOOL/CLUB:  J.L.

These kits, typically called rape kits, are often stored away in law enforcement facilities and can only be tested if requested by a detective or prosecutor. This results in numerous kits remaining untested and accumulating in what is known as rape kit backlog, leaving many rape victims unaware of their attacker and awaiting justice for long periods of time due to a lack of legislature mandating the testing of their kit. \n\nSection 2: There is currently no law in South Carolina requiring the testing of rape kits or dealing with backlog. This a pressing issue because it just leaves victims feeling helpless when law enforcement could be doing more to help them. We propose a law that requires all rape kits to be tested within 30 days of their collection. This would insure that any DNA evidence collected will be run through the criminal database to check to see if any existing information in the database matches that of the evidence collected in the rape kit.  \n\nSection 3: This bill will be funded by a statewide public sales tax increase of 0.5%. This tax increase would be allocated towards providing more jobs and resources to test the kits.\n\nSection 4: This bill will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. \n\nSection 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H14\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: B\nAUTHORS:  George DeCarvalho and Tucker Shaw\nBILL SPONSOR: Samantha Hutter and Megan Keech\nSCHOOL/CLUB:  J.L.

This is not an act to ban gay marriage, it is an act however to protect the rights of religious institutions. Those who have religious beliefs that marriage should be between one man and one woman (Judeo-Christian) or a man and multiple women (Islam) are protected under the 1st amendment from government hindrances on their ability to practice their religion freely. These religions see homosexuality as a sin and should not be faced with the choice of having to violate their moral code to avoid losing their constitutional rights.\n\nSection 2:  It is a fear of many religious leaders that because of their desire to freely practice religion (which is their right) they will lose their 501c3 status, or even be charged with a hate crime. This act prevents the government or any individual from impeding the free exercise of\xc2\xa0religion; a basic first amendment right. This act does not violate the 14th amendment because it does NOT condone the denial of public service to anyone for any reason. Our act would allow a religious institution to refuse to marry a homosexual couple solely because the moral code of said religion conflicts to homosexuality. Just as homosexuals want their rights protected and upheld, mosques, temples, and churches all deserve the same rights under the constitution.\n\nSection 3: This bill requires no funding.\n\nSection 4: This bill will be enforced by state courts.\n\nSection 5:  This bill will go into effect on January 01, 2016 with the signature of the youth governor.\xe2\x80\xa8', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015 \n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H15\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: C\nAUTHORS:  Abby Hall and Keyton Daniels \nBILL SPONSOR: Samantha Hutter and Megan Keech\nSCHOOL/CLUB:  J.L.

Students with this disability have a harder time processing material during class, which affects their GPA and future. \n\nSection 2: Currently in South Carolina, 1 in every 5 students has the disability of Dyslexia (There is no law stating that children with this disability are to be given any special treatment.  Our bill is going to provide money to put towards the training of resource teachers for the Ortan Gillingham curriculum. The resource teachers will be trained in the Ortan Gillingham curriculum in order to optimize the success of dyslexic students.  All resource teachers must be trained by the beginning of the 2017/2018 school year.\n\nSection 3:  This bill will be funded through revenue generated by the SC State Education Lottery.  The SC State Board of Education will then require all public school districts to have all resource teachers trained in the Ortan Gillingham curriculum.

There are 272 police agencies employing around 11,674 police officers in South Carolina. The tax increase would be about 1.2%.

The definition of \xe2\x80\x9chandheld electronic device\xe2\x80\x9d is any portable electronic device that requires the use of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s hands and is not part of the operating equipment of a motor vehicle, including (but not limited to) an electronic game, device for sending or receiving e-mail, text-messaging device, cellular telephone, and computer. \n\nSection 2:\t The use of hands-free electronic devices will be acceptable.

At any given moment during daylight hours across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or are manipulating electronic devices while driving, a number that has held steady since 2010. Engaging in visual-manual subtasks (such as reaching for a phone, dialing, and texting) associated with the use of hand-held phones and other portable devices increased the risk of getting into an accident by three times. A study from the University of Utah indicates that when both younger and older drivers used cell-phones, their reactions were 18% slower, and there was a two-fold increase in the number of rear-end collisions. For drivers 15-19 years old involved in fatal crashes, 21% of the distracted drivers were distracted by the use of cellular telephones. \n\nSection 5: The use of handheld electronic devices shall be banned in the state of South Carolina in order to prevent distracted driving.

Lunch is meant to be a break period, to rest your brain for the rest of the school day. Therefore, leaving schools grounds for lunch should be a part of the break period. \n\nSection 3:\t Students must have a method of transportation to participate in the off-campus lunch law. Walking off-campus is prohibited. If students do not have a vehicle, then they must stay at school for their lunch break. This law is only applicable to licensed drivers.

Students will be required to take the language class of their choice at specific times twice a week. \n\nSection 3:\t This bill allows non-English speaking students to be at the same level as others and take English as their second language through a specific class. Native-English speaking students will be expected to take French or Spanish. That way, all students are learning a new language throughout their elementary and middle school years.\n\nSection 4:\t After taking these language courses as a young student, students are more advanced in the language and can understand it more fluently when high school comes. This is important because in high school a student is only required to take two years of language to graduate. In two years a student will not be able to fully understand and reciprocate the language. Whereas if the student took the course throughout their entire education, he would be able to speak the language fluently or at least be able to comprehend the language better.\n\nSection 5: When signed into law, this bill will take effect on August 1, 2016.\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H26\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: B\nAUTHORS: Kaylyn Tyler and Isabelle Headrick\nBILL SPONSOR: \nSCHOOL/CLUB:  Eastside High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to limit the Class Sizes in K3-3rd Grades\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: The average class size in K3-3rd grade is 25-26 students. The average size in K3 is 9-10 students. The average class size in K-3rd grade would be reduced to 19-20 students. In K3, class size would be reduced to 7-8 students. \n\nSection 2:\t Students who come from groups that are traditionally disadvantaged in education will benefit from this bill the most. Students are less likely to be retained, more likely to stay in school and earn better grades. Reducing the class sizes in the early grades reduces the amount of distractions in the room and gives the teacher more time to devote to each child. In early grades, students are just beginning to learn the rules of the classroom. If they have more opportunity to interact with their teacher, they are more apt to feel that they can cope with these changes. Reducing class size is a great way for states and public schools to show that they are improving the quality of education because smaller classes allow teachers to spend more time on instruction and less on classroom management. \n\nSection 3:\t Classes with fewer students will have more one-on-one time with their teacher. This will help all students in K3 to 3rd grade because they will have more time with the teacher than if the teacher had to help 5 more students to understand something. Many studies have shown an increase in student achievement and fewer discipline problems as a result of class size reductions. \n\nSection 4:\t Education researchers suspect that class size reduction in early grades increases student achievement because there is a greater opportunity for individual interaction between student and teacher in a smaller class. This will benefit teachers also, because they feel less overwhelmed by having a bigger class. As a result, they are more likely to provide a supportive environment. \n\nSection 5: When signed into law, the first class size reduction will go into effect the upcoming school year in 2016-2017. \n\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives \nBILL NUMBER: H27\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: C\nAUTHORS: Zach Fahnle and Taylor Lomax \nBILL SPONSOR: \nSCHOOL/CLUB: Eastside High School \n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Amend Existing Child Labor Laws\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: Currently, South Carolina child labor regulations prohibit minors under the age of 16 from preparing food, operating lawn mowers and/or golf carts, and performing tasks requiring the use of a ladder. \n\nSection 2: This bill proposes a removal of the aforementioned restrictions, as they are generally unreasonable when considering the heightened sense of responsibility in teens who work. \n\nSection 3: In order to obtain employment, an interviewer must be able to clearly observe and distinguish traits of responsibility in potential job-holders.

The average class size is currently 25 students per teacher. The current average causes certain students not to reach their full potential and develop a personal relationship with their teacher.\n\nSection 2:\t To help increase the standards of education in students, student-to-teacher ratio will be reduced. This will allow for more interaction in the classroom between students and teacher and fewer distractions in a more intimate setting. As a result, students will have a clearer and increased understanding of what is being taught.\n\nSection 3:\t To gain the necessary funding, there will be a redistribution of state lottery funds from the college scholarship program. $2.7 billion has been spent on college scholarships whereas only $104 million is spent on programs in grades K-12. A redistribution of funds to K-12 programs appeals to a larger percent of the population. 30% of the population receives post-secondary education, and 83% of the population receives primary or secondary education. In addition, nearly 40% of inmates in state prison have not received a secondary education, indicating another reason to increase funding and focus on programs in grades K-12.\n\nSection 4:\t The Education Accountability Act Resource programs would enforce the Education Oversight Committee and the State Board of Education to handle redistributing the lottery funds to pay for more teachers, classrooms, and other supplies.\n\nSection 5: When signed into law, this bill will takeClear formatting and concise descriptions make for better debate and clearer                understanding!\nClear formatting and concise descriptions make for better debate and clearer                understanding!\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H35\xe2\x80\xa8RECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: E\xe2\x80\xa8AUTHORS: Ashelin Myus, Emily Garcia, & Lia Stone\nBILL SPONSOR: Mary Chandler and Lauren Drake\xe2\x80\xa8SCHOOL/CLUB: Southside Christian School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Enforce Paid Parental Leave in Businesses\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1:  Currently South Carolina does not have a state law requiring employers to offer paid parental leave.

These benefits include health care, food stamps, etc.  This allows for the enrollees to be spending a portion of their income on illegal or addictive substances while the government pays for the enrollees\xe2\x80\x99 essentials of modern life (phone, electric, water bills).  \n\nSection 2: Upon the application of this act, Medicaid and Welfare enrollees will undergo random drug testing to ensure valuable taxpayer money is not being wasted on illegal substances.  These drug tests can occur during any hospital visits an enrollee might make, or during regularly scheduled visits to a general practitioner. These tests can also occur during the SNAP and Welfare application process.  Once enrolled, enrollees must submit to at least two drug tests per year.  \n\nSection 3: According to a study conducted by UCLA at Berkeley, the US spends 152.8 billion dollars on welfare programs.  To ensure valuable taxpayer money is not wasted, abusers will be denied welfare and medicaid for a period of time, starting at one month and increasing each time they abuse after the original incident.

I believe that this practice is outdated and potentially dangerous to other drivers on the road. I propose that every five years, South Carolina Citizens should retake their Driver\xe2\x80\x99s Test to insure that they are following all state laws and regulations and are practicing safe driving daily.\n\nSection 2: \tTaking the test every five years would give more money to the state because in order to retake the test you would be charged a testing fee of $12.50. If the state government put a tax on the dmv for the quinquennial testing (government can only tax on the retesting fee), it would give them a little chunk of money and we are always looking for that. The State government could implement a .05% tax rate towards the dmv\xe2\x80\x99s $12.50 they make per citizen that has to retest. That would give our government 0.625 cents per person. South Carolina (in 2014) had the population of 4.832 million people and it is still constantly rising. That tax towards the amount of people would give our State Government 3,020,000 million dollars every five years!  \n\nSection 3: \tSouth Carolina is rated second to worst by Car Insurance Comparison and that is a problem I think we need to fix. South Carolina is ranked number eight in the nation for fatalities in wrecks that involve alcohol. 40% of the 767 crash fatalities last year involved an impaired driver in one of the cars. We are ranked number five in the nation in careless driving.  We are ranked number fifteen in the nation for speeding contributing to fatalities in car wrecks. 40% of people that are involved in fatal car wrecks weren\xe2\x80\x99t wearing seatbelts. In order to cause less laws and regulations from being broken and to stop careless driving from occurring we need to put retesting into effect! Making the retesting a new law, would benefit us all because it would give South Carolina Citizens the knowledge again and help them to remember that laws, regulations, the traffic signs, and all of the things not to do while driving. It would help us to practice safer driving and for us to go up in the rankings as well. It would defiantly cause the fatalities to occur less as well. The retesting would refurbish our brains with the knowledge we need to know to practice safer driving and if you fail the test it looks like you won\xe2\x80\x99t be driving till you pass! This would keep safer drivers on the road and not so safe drivers off the road. All of this retesting would cause the statistics I mentioned in the beginning of this section to change. Plus, it would give a tax to our state government, which would be great because hey, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like money? This would be a really good tradeoff for our government and cause a safer economy for our citizens.\n\nSection 4: It would be funded by the citizens of South Carolina because they would have to pay to retake the test and then government would receive a tax from the dmv\xe2\x80\x99s allowing them to make money off of it. The $12.50 paid from a single citizen to the dmv, would be taxed by our government, and that would give them .0625 per person since they would be taxing 0.05%. Safer driving, less fatal wrecks, and money paid to the dmv\xe2\x80\x99s and taxed by the state government, would make a safer and more stable economy. This would be a win win for the state of South Carolina.\n\nSection 5: \tIf/when signed into law, the retesting would begin on January 1st, 2016, and would be for anyone who needs to renew their Driver\xe2\x80\x99s License and then they would start the cycle of the quinquennial process of retesting to improve safer roads. It would continue on for every one throughout the year and whoever needs to renew then needs to retake. Then five years later the retesting would take place again.

In poorer districts, only $2100 is able to be raised for each student. This is due to Act 388, which changed public schools from being funded by property taxes to a 1% sales tax. \n\nSection 2: This bill will re-determine how funds for public schools are raised and distributed. A population based system taking funds from property taxes will be instituted. \n\nSection 3: In 2004, the base student cost (BSC) per year was $3170, and was able to be paid in full. Since then it has decreased by about $400. Changing back to a property tax as the method of raising funds for public schools will allow for better education for each student. Additionally, the money given from the state to these school districts will be distributed based on population, so that each student's BSC can be met, unlike the current situation. \n\nSection 4: Property taxes would be allocated by a special committee in the state government, and any schools that provide false numbers of students for extra funding would lose all state funds, which make up approximately 50% of their funding. \n\nSection 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.\n", '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28TH Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H54\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: F\nAUTHORS: Desiree Occilien, Cassidy Wilson\nBILL SPONSOR: \nSCHOOL/CLUB: Hammond School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Incentivize the Use of Energy Efficient Vehicles in South Carolina\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: South Carolina citizens need to decrease their reliance on gasoline. There are two major reasons for urgency of this bill. Firstly, the use of gasoline increases the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A leading example of the effects of greenhouse gases is global warming. Humans possess a big role in the production of the excessive amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. The problem does not really lie in the fact that cars produce carbon dioxide because they are recycling carbon dioxide that is already in the air, the problem lies in the fact that we keep taking fossil fuels which releases old carbon dioxide, that is not supposed to be in current circulation in the air. An increase of carbon dioxide in addition with the other greenhouse gases, will over time increase the atmospheric temperature, melt polar ice caps, and eventually deplete fresh water resources and destroy environments resulting in the extinction of many species. Another reason, and a very important one, that ties to our role as a part of a powerful nation in the world, is the fact that we rely too much fossil fuels; which creates our gasoline and many other sources of energy. It is inevitable that we will run out of fossil fuels, must likely in the near future. The running out of fossil fuels, with no other reliable resource in energy, will result in a dramatic rise in prices, and possible a war over fossil fuels.\n\nSection 2: It is important that South Carolina starts to become more self-sufficient in regards to energy; and it needs to be done one step at a time. It is understood that South Carolina cannot stop its reliance on fossil fuels all at once. So, we propose that citizens of South Carolina use Flex Fuel and electric vehicles. Once South Carolina becomes independent from the use of gasoline, we can help the nation to become self-sufficient too. And, once we run out of fossil fuels, our nation, America, will be able to help other nations around the world rely on other sources for energy, such as wind turbines and geothermal energy.\n\nSection 3:  Flex Fuel cars have been around since the 1990s. These vehicles have the ability to use both gasoline and ethanol-gasoline blends up to 85%. It would be preferable to use the Flex Fuel cars with the ethanol-gasoline blend to help lesser our reliance on gasoline and therefore our reliance on fossil fuels. The use of electric cars would move us away from fossil fuels too and be beneficial for the environment, plus over the years, electric cars have become more affordable. Flex Fuel cars and electric cars are available under many popular name brands which include Ford, GMC, and Mercedes. The vehicle types range from trucks and SUVs to motorcycles and mopeds. We would encourage the use of these vehicles by using tax dollars to create charging stations for electric cars and providing tax breaks and subsidies for companies that produce Flex Fuel cars and electric cars to encourage them to build businesses here and therefore bettering our economy. We would remove property tax from the purchase of Flex Fuel and electric cars. There are also tax credits that are currently offered to people who own certain electric cars approved by the government. We are encouraging people to start buying energy efficient vehicle and hopefully in a few generations, everyone will own an energy efficient vehicle.\n\nSection 4:  To be clear, the money is coming from tax dollars to construct electric car charging stations. The tax dollars will come from a penny tax on gasoline. We also plan to remove property tax from electric and Flex Fuel vehicles. \n\nSection 5:  When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28TH Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H55\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: A\nAUTHORS: Edward Mitchell and Mark Cai\nBILL SPONSOR: \nSCHOOL/CLUB: Hammond School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Provide Senior Citizens with Absentee Ballots\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: In the United States, senior citizens make up a large portion of the electorate.

Recently, the domestic violence rates in South Carolina have doubled the national average, leaving South Carolina as the state with the highest ratio of domestic violence in the country. A woman is killed by a man every 12 days on average in South Carolina. South Carolina has been ranked in the top 10 of states with the highest domestic violence rates every year since 2000, showing that domestic violence is not just a short term issue. Something must be done to drastically change these statistics and we believe that this bill will greatly contribute to the declining of these ratios by creating more awareness about domestic violence throughout the youth of South Carolina using the public school systems and several different domestic violence help shelters throughout the different counties. This bill would also bring upon tighter regulations and stronger enforcement of the domestic violence laws that are already in place currently.\n\nSection 2:\tUnder this bill, there will be a large non-profit organization created throughout the public school systems as well as any private or charter schools who wish to incorporate this organization within their school. This volunteer-based program would create a strong partnership between the domestic abuse shelters and the public schools, where weekly assemblies would be held at the school where speakers from these shelters would come to talk to the kids. These speakers could be those who have suffered from abuse and will teach the kids about the severities of domestic violence and what to do if you, or someone you love is suffering through this. This organization would be greatly beneficial by raising more awareness that is needed throughout the state and would protect all of those who have suffered/may suffer with domestic violence in the past or in the future. This bill would also put greater restrictions on the current laws about domestic violence.\n\nSection 3: There are domestic violence shelters in Greenville, Pickens, Anderson, and Oconee county and the one that is partnered with your school is whatever shelter is closest to it in location. The further restrictions on the current laws are as follows;\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tFirst offense- person found guilty is fined at a minimum of $2,000 and a maximum of $5,000 and put on probation for 6 months with mandatory counseling that the abuser must pay for himself.\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tSecond offense- Person found guilty fined at a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $8,000 and in prison no less than 1 year and no longer than 5 years, depending on the severity of the crime.\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tThird offense- person found guilty in prison for no less than a 5 year prison sentence with a fine of a minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of $20,000, depending on the severity of the crime.\nHalf of all of the proceeds from the fines will go towards the domestic shelters and half will go to the state treasury where they will then be dispersed to wherever it need be.\n\nSection 4: \tThe only effects of the passage of this bill are positive ones. It will decrease the amount of domestic violence that happens in the state of South Carolina, raise awareness for domestic abuse, educate the youth of South Carolina about what to do if they have suspicions of someone they know is suffering from domestic violence and what to do if they themselves are suffering from it. It will not only raise awareness but it will also make the punishments more severe for the abusers and will have an amazing impact for the abused to turn their lives around.\n\nSection 5: \tWhen signed into law, it will take place on January 1, 2016.\n\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H74\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: B\nAUTHORS:  Elizabeth Caboy, Valerie Calvo\nSPONSORS: Chafer, Tierney\nSCHOOL/CLUB:  Bluffton High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Focus Prison on Rehabilitation\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: Presently, America has about 25% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s incarcerated people.

Tuition is growing at a greater rate than inflation; for example, in 2013 tuition and fees at private institutions rose by 3.7%, public institutions by 2.9 % and inflation, as measured by personal consumption expenditures index, rose by 1.4 % (2013 is the smallest increase in a decades for both the cost of tuition and inflation). Simultaneously, student loans are binding and unforgivable--even through bankruptcy and death. As a result, college is becoming an unattainable goal as is evident by a decrease in both enrollment and borrowing. Affordability must be examined as higher education is essential for employment, global competition, economic growth, and innovation.\n\nSection 2: \n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe South Carolina Department of Education will explore other opportunities--such as European models-- to increase affordability and report those findings to both the President and Congressional Education Committees. \n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tLegislative policy whereby any college or university in South Carolina to receiving state federal funds (directly or indirectly) may not raise its costs above the rate of inflation. \n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tReduce South Carolina Government\xe2\x80\x99s profit on student loans by reducing.the interest rate for government backed student loans.\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tLegislatively pass a law allowing students to refinance their student loans.\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tPlace a 4% cap on student interest rates that are through South Carolina government backed loans; for instance, rates could go lower, but not higher than 4%\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tLegislatively pass a law allowing student loans to be forgiven in the case of bankruptcy or death.\n\nSection 3: \xc2\xa0A college education would be more affordable and South Carolina students would leave college with less debt.

These will only be able to be accessed by authorized personnel. \n\nSection 5: When signed into law, schools will need to begin personnel training immediately and will be expected to implement all parts of this bill on or by January 1, 2016.\n\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H82\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: D\nAUTHORS: Denny Villatoro\nBILL SPONSOR: Chafer, Tierney\nSCHOOL/CLUB: Bluffton High School\n\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nPromoting Democracy in South Carolina\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: This bill will give public officials a paid day off of work on the days of the federal elections to promote participation in elections.\n\nSection 2: This will go into effect by the time of the next set of these elections, being November 8th, 2016.\n\nSection 3: This will require one additional paid day off every two years for public officials to be able to vote for other public officials and that will require no additional funding for public organizations.\n\nSection 4: This day will be made an official state holiday upon the enactment of this bill meaning public institutions will be closed on the proposed holiday such as on any other holiday.\n\nSection 5: Businesses in the private sphere will be required to provide a minimum two hour paid break time on this proposed holiday if the employee\xe2\x80\x99s shift starts before the voting booths close.\n\t\xe2\x80\xa2\tAn exception to this rule would be if none of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s hours fall within the time the local voting booths are open, but they will not be allowed to schedule employees within one hour and a half of local voting booth\xe2\x80\x99s opening or closing times.\n\n', 'SOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28TH Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H83\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: E\nAUTHORS: Jaimie Grazioso and Cristal Boyce\nSCHOOL/CLUB: Brashier Middle College\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Require Protection on Gun Prohibited Property\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1:  If a property (school, movie theatre, church) does not allow concealed weapons, at least one trained person in the usage of guns must be present in order to protect the individuals on that property.\n\t    \nSection 2:  The trained person on the property must have passed a background check, drug test, and must be certified in safety of using a concealed weapon.

We currently rank 43rd out of all the states in the U.S. \n\nSection 2:  We will be raising the tax on cigarettes by five cents annually until it reaches a cap of two dollars. \n\nSection 3: On average, 38% of South Carolinians are active smokers. The goal of this bill is to make this number go down. By raising the tax on cigarettes to two dollars, it will make many people reluctant to buy them.

This will allow students to not be required to carry their textbooks to and from class. Instead, students will come to class each day and use a textbook from the class set. \n\nSection 3: It will also decrease the amount of money needing to be spent on them because textbooks only need to be provided for individual classrooms rather than each individual student. Instead of printing and replacing textbooks for each student every year a significantly less amount need to be printed. This saves the state more money to use in other areas.\n\nSection 4:  At the beginning of the school year a passcode and website will be given to each student which provides them access to the online textbook.

No US federal laws mandate vaccination, but all 50 states require certain vaccinations for children entering public schools. Most states offer medical and religious exemptions; and some states allow philosophical exemptions. (Procon.org) They believe children\xe2\x80\x99s immune systems can deal with most infections naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a child may cause side effects, including seizures, paralysis, and death. They contend that numerous studies prove that vaccines may trigger problems like autism,\xc2\xa0ADHD, and diabetes. (ProCon.org)\n\nSection 2: In the State of South Carolina there are nine vaccines a student must have to admit into a public school. Although these vaccines are valuable for the health and well-being of all, the rapid administration of these vaccines is dangerous and can harm young growing children.  The preservatives and viruses contained in vaccines could cause a reaction and change the child\xe2\x80\x99s life forever.  A baby\xe2\x80\x99s body needs time to develop. By the time the body is two, the body is growing rapidly. The brain is a fragile part of the body and by sending multiple vaccines in a fast pace of time filled with harmful ingredients into a child immune system is just wrong. \n\nSection 3: The schedule of vaccinating children shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be rushed. The process of putting the vaccines into a child\xe2\x80\x99s body should not be standard for all children.  The schedule should be decided on by the pediatrician guided by a child\xe2\x80\x99s response the government has no right to determine what and when we put into our children bodies.  By allowing the right for the parents and doctors to determine when the child should receive the vaccines will lower the side effects of vaccines. The intervals for many of these vaccines are a mere two to four weeks. This can be toxic to vibrant growing cells in the bodies of our children.\n\nSection 4:  By allowing more time for vaccines to take place and to have a choice on the amount of vaccines will lower the amount of side effects in South Carolina. We would limit the amount of vaccines given to a child from a minimum of 6 month intervals.\n\nSection 5: When signed into law, the bill will go into effect January 2016.\n\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28TH Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINTES IN: House of Representatives\nBILL NUMBER: H89\nRECOMMEND FOR COMMITTEE: E\nAUTHORS: Zach Marion; Jared Prince\nBILL SPONSOR: Trey Yanity\t\nSCHOOL/CLUB: Mauldin High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nAn Act to Legalize Medicinal MDMA\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: The current status of MDMA in South Carolina is a Schedule 1 drug; which means it has no current accepted medical use.\n\nSection 2:  MDMA is a psychoactive drug of the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine.

This is efficient because the people paying a higher Property Tax usually consume more, therefore paying the same amount in Sales Taxes as they would have previously paid through both sales and property taxes. \n\nSection 3: Because this act would end property tax on all personal property, those who owned no personal property would receive an incentive from the government of 3% of their yearly income.

I believe that this practice is outdated and \npotentially dangerous to other drivers on the road. I propose that every five years,  \nSouth Carolina Citizens should retake their Driver\xe2\x80\x99s Test to insure that they are \nfollowing all state laws and regulations and are practicing safe driving daily.\n\nSection 2: Taking the test every five years would give more money to the state \nbecause in order to retake the test you would be charged a testing fee of $12.50. If \nthe state government put a tax on the dmv for the quinquennial testing (government \ncan only tax on the retesting fee), it would give them a little chunk of money and we \nare always looking for that. The State government could implement a .05% tax rate \ntowards the dmv\xe2\x80\x99s $12.50 they make per citizen that has to retest. That would give \nour government 0.625 cents per person. South Carolina (in 2014) had the population \nof 4.832 million people and it is still constantly rising. That tax towards the amount \nof people would give our State Government 3,020,000 million dollars every five \nyears!  \n\nSection 3: South Carolina is rated second to worst by Car Insurance Comparison and \nthat is a problem I think we need to fix. South Carolina is ranked number eight in the \nnation for fatalities in wrecks that involve alcohol. 40% of the 767 crash fatalities last \nyear involved an impaired driver in one of the cars. We are ranked number five in the \nnation in careless driving.  We are ranked number fifteen in the nation for speeding \ncontributing to fatalities in car wrecks. 40% of people that are involved in fatal car \nwrecks weren\xe2\x80\x99t wearing seatbelts. In order to cause less laws and regulations from \nbeing broken and to stop careless driving from occurring we need to put retesting \ninto effect! Making the retesting a new law, would benefit us all because it would give \nSouth Carolina Citizens the knowledge again and help them to remember that laws, \nregulations, the traffic signs, and all of the things not to do while driving. It would \nhelp us to practice safer driving and for us to go up in the rankings as well. It would \ndefiantly cause the fatalities to occur less as well. The retesting would refurbish our \nbrains with the knowledge we need to know to practice safer driving and if you fail \nthe test it looks like you won\xe2\x80\x99t be driving till you pass! This would keep safer drivers \non the road and not so safe drivers off the road. All of this retesting would cause the \nstatistics I mentioned in the beginning of this section to change. Plus, it would give a \ntax to our state government which would be great because hey, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like \nmoney? This would be a really good tradeoff for our government and cause a safer \neconomy for our citizens.\n\nSection 4: It would be funded by the citizens of South Carolina because they would\nhave to pay to retake the test and then government would receive a tax from the \ndmv\xe2\x80\x99s allowing them to make money off of it. The $12.50 paid from a single citizen \nto the dmv, would be taxed by our government, and that would give them .0625 per \nperson since they would be taxing 0.05%. Safer driving, less fatal wrecks, and money \npaid to the dmv\xe2\x80\x99s and taxed by the state government, would make a safer and more \nstable economy. This would be a win win for the state of South Carolina.\n\nSection 5: If/when signed into law, the retesting would begin on January 1st, 2016, \nand would be for anyone who needs to renew their Driver\xe2\x80\x99s License and then they \nwould start the cycle of the quinquennial process of retesting to improve safer roads. \nIt would continue on for every one throughout the year and whoever needs to renew \nthen needs to retake. Then five years later the retesting would take place again. \n(license needs to be renewed yearly though).\n', '\nSOUTH CAROLINA YMCA\nYOUTH IN GOVERNMENT\n28th Annual Model Legislature\nNovember 18-21, 2015\n\nBILL ORIGINATES IN:  House of Representatives \nBILL NUMBER: H130\nRECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: B\nAUTHORS: Inina Walker, Emily Roman, and Anajae Irby\nBILL SPONSOR: \nSCHOOL/CLUB: Legacy Charter High School\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED\n\nThis is an act to have stronger consequences of being caught of human trafficking.\n\nBE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSection 1: Penalties for offenders charged with human trafficking are not strong enough.
